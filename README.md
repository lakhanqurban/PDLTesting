# Abstract

In this paper, we investigate testing practices in the domain of Deep Learning (DL) systems by analyzing Python-based GitHub projects. Our findings provide valuable insights into the state-of-the-art in DL system testing, identifying gaps and opportunities for improving software quality assurance. We propose a structured framework for analyzing testing approaches in open-source repositories, offering actionable recommendations for developers and researchers.
